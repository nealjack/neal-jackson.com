#### Hi, I'm Neal Jackson, a PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley.
  I work as a Research Assistant with Prabal Dutta and [Lab11](http://lab11.eecs.umich.edu/).
  My research is focused on enabling ubiquitous sensing with low power embedded
  devices. I developed a long-lifetime indoor sensor
  mote named [Permamote](https://github.com/lab11/permamote). Permamote
  combines energy-harvesting, a backing primary cell battery, and the newest,
  lowest power components to achieve reliable operation over a greater than 10
  year lifetime. Permamote performs ambient environmental sensing,
  but its heirarchical and modular power supply can be reused to serve various
  application specific designs.

  Most notably, I adapted the platform and created
  [Permacam](https://github.com/lab11/permamote/blob/master/hardware/permacam/rev_a/permacam_pcb.png)
  to support an ultra-low power camera for wireless, long-lifetime computer vision tasks.
