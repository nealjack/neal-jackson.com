#### Hi, I'm Neal Jackson, a PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley.
  I work as a Research Assistant with Prabal Dutta and [Lab11](http://lab11.eecs.umich.edu/).
  My research is focused on enabling ubiquitous sensing with low power embedded
  devices. Most recently, I've been developing a long-lifetime indoor sensor
  mote named [Permamote](https://github.com/lab11/permamote). Permamote
  combines energy-harvesting, a backing primary cell battery, and the newest,
  lowest power components to achieve reliable operation over a greater than 10
  year lifetime. Currently, Permamote performs ambient environmental sensing,
  but its heirarchical power supply can be reused to serve various application
  specific designs.
  I also spend a lot of time working on the
  [Signpost](https://github.com/lab11/signpost) project, an effort to develop a
  modular and easily deployable sensor node to lower the bar to city-wide
  sensing, research, and applications.
