#### Hi, I'm Neal Jackson, a first year PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley.
  I work as a Research Assistant with Prabal Dutta and [Lab11](http://lab11.eecs.umich.edu/).
  My research is focused on enabling ubiquitous sensing with low power embedded
  devices. Most recently, I've been working on the
  [Signpost](https://github.com/lab11/signpost) project, an effort to develop a
  modular, easily deployable, and user-friendly sensor node to enable city-wide
  sensing, research, and applications. I've also developed the
  [GAP](http://lab11.eecs.umich.edu/GAP) (Generic Access Point), a gateway for
  resource constrained embedded devices.
